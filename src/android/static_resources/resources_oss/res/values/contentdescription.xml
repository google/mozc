         Policy: Use Kanji as long as possible in order to improve the quality of TTS.
         If written down in Hiragana, many information which is required for accent lacks.
         But some entries are written down. For example, raw 'g' is spoken as "ぐらむ"
         so explicitly "じー" is used instead.
