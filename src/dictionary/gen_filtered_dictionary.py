r"""A tool to remove specified words from dictionary files.

gen_filtered_dictionary.py --output filtered_dictionary.txt

--dictionary_txts data/dictionary_oss/dictionary0*.txt

### Format of dictionary_filter.tsv

| key      | value    |
| :------: | :------: |
| あるぱか | 或るパカ |

* `key` and `value` are the regexp patterns of words to be removed.
* Each line is extended to the following regexp pattern:
  + `'^{key}\t\\d+\t\\d+\t\\d+\t{value}(\t.*)?\n$'`
