===================================

Copyright 2010-2025 Google LLC

Mozc is a Japanese Input Method Editor (IME) designed for multi-platform such as
Android OS, Apple macOS, Chromium OS, GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows.  This
OpenSource project originates from
[Google Japanese Input](http://www.google.com/intl/ja/ime/).

Mozc is not an officially supported Google product.

What's Mozc?
------------
For historical reasons, the project name *Mozc* has two different meanings:

1. Internal code name of Google Japanese Input that is still commonly used
   inside Google.
2. Project name to release a subset of Google Japanese Input in the form of
   source code under OSS license without any warranty nor user support.

In this repository, *Mozc* means the second definition unless otherwise noted.

Detailed differences between Google Japanese Input and Mozc are described in [About Branding](docs/about_branding.md).

Release Plan
------------

tl;dr. **There is no stable version.**

As described in [About Branding](docs/about_branding.md) page, Google does
not promise any official QA for OSS Mozc project.  Because of this,
Mozc does not have a concept of *Stable Release*.  Instead we change version
number every time when we introduce non-trivial change.  If you are
interested in packaging Mozc source code, or developing your own products
based on Mozc, feel free to pick up any version.  They should be equally
stable (or equally unstable) in terms of no official QA process.

information and useful links about recent changes.
